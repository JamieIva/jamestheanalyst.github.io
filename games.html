									<h1>Video Game Sales</h1>
									<p>In this project we take a look at the sales of video game consoles from respectable companies. The companies we will be looking at are Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox. Due to the competitiveness between these two companies I would like to see which company has sold more units and what genre of video games is their best seller.</p>
                                    <p>I have cleaned the data and compiled them into one sheet, formatted the cells.</p>
								</header>

								<div class="image main"><img src="pics/xx.jpg" alt="" /></div>

								<h2>QUESTIONS TO ANSWER</h2>
								<ol>
								<li>  What is the best-selling genre for each console?</li>
								<li>	Which company sells the most games?</li>
								<li>	In what year did both consoles sell the most units?</li>
                                <li>	What year did video games have the most sales?</li>
                                <li>	Which console is closing the gap behind both PlayStation and XBOX?</li>
								</ol>

								<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>	Action games are the selling ticket for both consoles. Each year action games are released under different subgenres, for example, battle royal games.</li>
									<li>	 PlayStation sells the most games across all platforms and have been dominating the market for years.</li>
									<li>3. </li>
                                    <li>	2008 was the year video games sold the most games.</li>
                                    <li>	Nintendo is the video company closing its gap to its competitors. </li>
								</ol>

								<h2>Date Analysis</h2>
								<p>In this data we look at the best selling genres across all platforms and which genre sells the most.</p>

								<div class="image" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><img src="pics/genre.png" alt="Data grid"></div>

								<p>As we see in this, we confirm my hypothesis that action games have the most sales across all genres and it does well on all platforms.</p>

								<h2>PLATFORM SALES</h2>
								<div class="image" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><img src="pics/platformsales.png" alt="Data grid" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
								<p>We can see that Sony's PlayStation 2 was the best-selling platform ever and it is still used to this day even though the services for the console has been closed. It is hailed as the pincacle of gaming and to most, the introduction to video games.</p>
								
                                <h2>PlayStation And Xbox Sales</h2>
                                <p></p>
								<div class="image" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><img src="pics/PSsale.png" alt="Data grid" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
								<p>In this data, we can see when each platform started selling and when it was discontinued</p>
                                <p>We notice that Sony’s PlayStation peaked in 2004 and then started to trickle down. This was due to the company planning to roll out their awaited Launch for of their third roll out of home console, the PlayStation 3.</p>
								<h2>INFLATION IN 2022</h2>
								<div class="image" style="margin-bottom: 2em;"><img src="pics/2022inf.png" alt="Data grid" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
								
								<p>In here we see developing nations for example, Venezuela, Argentina, Arzerbaijan and Ghana received a huge spike in 2022 alone compared to the alreay developed nations which proves my theory. </p>
								
								<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
								
								<P>So, with the data above we notice inflation received a huge spike in 2018 which crashed the market and bounced back steadily in 2019 and 2020 up until 2021 and we notice that it is steadily going back up again following the trend of inflation.</P>
								
								<p>With our analysis in the first diagram, we know we can predict that inflation will continue to climb.</p>
