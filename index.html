							<div><h2>Web Development projects</h2></div>
							<div><h2>A Movie Search App</H2>
								 <p>I developed a responsive movie web search application using React.js and the OMDb API to provide a seamless user experience. 
									The app allows users to search for movies by title, dynamically retrieving detailed information such as the release year, genre, director, actors, and plot summary from the OMDb database.</p> 
								 <p>The interface, built with React.js, ensures smooth interactions with real-time updates and efficient data handling.
									In addition to the core search functionality, I implemented various React components to manage the user interface, including search bars, movie detail displays, 
									and error handling for instances where movies arenâ€™t found. 
									The app is fully responsive, and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. 
									This project demonstrates my ability to integrate third-party APIs, manage state within a React application, and create a user-friendly, 
									responsive web experience.
								</p>

								<h2>News website</h2>
								<p>I designed and developed a fully responsive news website that serves as a comprehensive platform for delivering real-time news updates to users. 
									The project is built using C# using Visual Studio, providing a solid and scalable back-end architecture. 
									Leveraging The Guardian API, the website dynamically fetches and displays the latest news articles, 
									covering a wide range of categories such as world news, sports, technology, and entertainment.
								</p>
								<p>The integration with The Guardian's API involved handling JSON data, managing API requests, and ensuring efficient data parsing to present content seamlessly to users. 
									I implemented features like category filtering, search functionality, and pagination to enhance user experience and navigation.
								</p>
								<p>The website also includes a clean, user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across devices. 
									This project showcases my proficiency in C#, my ability to work with third-party APIs, and my skills in creating dynamic, data-driven web applications. 
									Through this project, I demonstrated my commitment to delivering high-quality, functional web solutions that meet user needs.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h2>Ticket Sales</h2>
								<p>
									I developed a responsive web application for ticket sales using C# in Visual Studio, with a MySQL database for data management. 
									This project involved creating a user-friendly interface where users can browse events, view ticket availability, and make purchases. 
									The web page is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
								</p>
								<p>
									In this project, I utilized C# for backend development, managing tasks such as handling event data, ticket inventory, and processing transactions securely. 
									The MySQL database was integrated to store and manage all relevant data efficiently. 
									The front-end was designed to be intuitive and responsive, providing real-time updates on ticket availability and a seamless purchasing process. 
									This project showcases my ability to develop a full-stack application using C#, integrate it with a MySQL database, and create a responsive design that enhances user interaction and experience.
